# FIZZ BUZZ

# Your goal is print all the numbers up to a chosen value.
# However, any number divisible by 3 will be replaced by the word "Fizz"
# Any number divisible by the number 5 will be replaced by the word "Buzz"
# Any number divisible by both will be replaced by the word "FizzBuzz"

# 1. Your code should prompt the user to input a number.
# 2. Start printing every number up to that number with the replacements mentioned above
# 3. Keep a running list of all numbers that were replaced by Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz separately
# 4. After the target number is reached, print out the 3 lists

# Here is an example output for the target number of 16 (Note: yours will probably be on separate lines. That's ok):
# 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16
# The Fizz numbers were [3, 6, 9, 12]
# The Buzz numbers were [5,10]
# The FizzBuzz numbers were [15]

# Hint: to determine if a number is divisible by another you can use the modulo function
# Modulo give the remainder after dividing. The symbol for modulo is %. Here is an example:
# 10 % 3 == 1
